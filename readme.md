#Image2MIDI

**convert image to midi pianoroll art or random melody**

simply

```bash
pip install -r req.txt
```

and run

```bash
image2midi.py inputimage outputmidifile
```

to convert an image into a midi pianoroll picture (not very practical and it will sound terrible but it's cool)

or

```bash
image2melody.py inputimage outputmidifile
```

to create random melody from an image (also not very practical but it's just fun)

there are samples result in sample directory, have fun
